        <p><strong>多What is a Program?</strong></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>A program is a Software entity that allows us to solve a specific problem. We say that it is a Software entity since it is not a set of physical components (such as hardware) but allows us to manipulate them. When we talk about a program, we refer to a set of logical elements (called Algorithms) that are specified, designed and later implemented by the development team.</p>
